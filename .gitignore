## Wordpress config
## The idea is to version as little as possible:
## - a theme you are working on (mytheme)
## - your custom plugins

!/wordpress/.gitkeep

# This is the MariaDB data folder
/data/*
!/data/.gitkeep

# Wordpress files
wordpress/*
!wordpress/wp-content/

wordpress/wp-content/*
!wordpress/wp-content/themes/
!wordpress/wp-content/plugins/

# Version only your theme...
wordpress/wp-content/themes/*
#!wordpress/wp-content/themes/mytheme

# ...and your plugins
wordpress/wp-content/plugins/*
#!wordpress/wp-content/plugins/myplugin.php
#!wordpress/wp-content/plugins/myplugin
